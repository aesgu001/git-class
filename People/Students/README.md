### Registering to gitlearn as a student

To enroll in a course, create a file named under your github user name like so,
`vim <github-username>`, and fill in your student info in that file in this format:

```
name = <student-name>
giturl = https://github.com/<github-username>/gitlearn.git

github = <github-username>
```
